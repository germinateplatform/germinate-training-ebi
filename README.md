# Germinate Training

This training was created for the EMBL EBI course 'Plant genomes: from data to discovery'

The following material has been developed to allow you to get some experience in using Germinate. It can be taken at your own pace and each section forms a self contained set of learning materials which we will work through during this training. If you follow the order of the training material each will build on what you have learned in the previous. These materials will compliment the presentations that are provided within the Plant Genomes course you are undertaking.

To get started go to https://germinateplatform.github.io/germinate-training-ebi/

There may be more content here than we can cover in the course but don't worry, you can bookmark this page and come back again in the future.

Additional information on Germinate is available from https://germinate.hutton.ac.uk including links to other crop specific databases and papers, code and other resources on using the platform.

If you have any questions or any suggestions on how we can improve this resource then please get in touch or pass on feedback at the end of this course. We can be contacted by germinate@hutton.ac.uk or by reaching out to us on social media @germinatehub on X. This training has been written and developed by Paul Shaw and Sebastian Raubach at the James Hutton Institute, Invergowrie, DD2 5DA, Scotland.
