# Plant genomes: from data to discovery EBI Virtual Course 
# Using Germinate  Friday 22 November 2024


Last Updated: 5th November 2024

The following material has been developed to allow you to get some experience in using Germinate. It can be taken at your own pace and each section forms a self contained set of learning materials which we will work through during this training. If you follow the order of the training material each will build on what you have learned in the previous. These materials will compliment the information that is provided within the Plant Genomes course you are undertaking at EBI.
